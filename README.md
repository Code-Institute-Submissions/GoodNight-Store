# Good Night - all what you need is a good sleep.

Good Night project is my final project during studing Software Web Developing in Code Institute. It is a e-commerce website with products which give better sleep.
My wife and I came up with the idea when we both sat sleepy after a day's work. That day I decided that whatever happened in the evening I would have an idea for my last milestone project. And we came up with an online store with a 'good sleep' product. A 'good sleep' that customers will be able to get when buying products in the store.
Products such as pajamas, pillows, bedding and aromatherapy accessories.

# UX

I started designing the website with a two necessary assumptions:
-   modern design,
-   responsiveness.

To find more details of the requirements, I have defined a group of people who will be potential customers of the store and what are the needs of them. 
They will be people of all ages, who like to sleep, who care about the comfort of sleep and for whom sleep is relaxation. They will also be parents and people who wear pajamas.
Users will come to the website to find way of better sleep and the products for good sleeping. To help achieve this, I have defined further requirements, such as:
-   friendly design,
-   dreamlike design.

Then I created a user stories to better define the needs and further requirements of the site.

[User Stories](Readme-purpose/user-stories.pdf)

<!-- Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

<!-- Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
